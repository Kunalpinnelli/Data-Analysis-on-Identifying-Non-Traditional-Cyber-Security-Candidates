# CyberMindsProject

Spring-2023 Capstone Project

The field of cybersecurity demands a diverse set of skills and capabilities crucial for various roles within the industry. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of skilled professionals, highlighting the need for a more inclusive workforce that mirrors the communities it serves. This project aims to address this issue by identifying potential candidates from non-traditional backgrounds.

The approach involves examining the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) outlined in the NICE Framework by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS). By analyzing job postings across diverse platforms, we aim to identify the common skills required for cybersecurity roles. Resumes from a variety of backgrounds were collected to gauge diversity in the cybersecurity job market.

To achieve our goal, Natural Language Processing and machine learning algorithms, including Cosine Similarities, will be employed to analyze job postings and identify potential candidates from non-traditional backgrounds. Additionally, demographic data from the US Census will be scrutinized based on geography, ethnicity, gender, and educational backgrounds to understand the demographics of the cybersecurity workforce and pinpoint areas lacking diversity.

Throughout the project, it became evident that less than 20% of the collected data represented candidates from non-traditional backgrounds. The ensuing report offers a comprehensive analysis of our findings, aiming to contribute to increased diversity in the cybersecurity workforce and address the shortage of skilled professionals.
